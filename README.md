# Requirements/Dependencies:

# `pip install selenium`

- Download and install Chrome Driver Binary File from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and set the path of installed file in the python script.

# Working:

It will ask you to mention the path on your local machine where you want to store the downloads

Change the range of packs accordingly by visiting cure.fit site and seeing what is the range in url of the package you want to download videos of.

Then it will start downloading :)
